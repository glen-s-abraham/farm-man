When building a farm management application for hydroponics, it's essential to include comprehensive datasets that capture the critical information of each system. Below is a detailed list of possible fields that you should consider including in your application to effectively monitor and manage your hydroponic farm systems:

System Identification:

System ID: Unique identifier for each hydroponic system
Location: Physical location of the system within the facility
System Type: e.g., NFT (Nutrient Film Technique), DWC (Deep Water Culture), Ebb and Flow, Aeroponics, etc.
Installation Date: When the system was installed
Capacity: Number of plants that can be grown simultaneously
Plant Information:

Crop/Plant Type: Species or variety of the plant
Planting Date: When the plants were introduced to the system
Expected Harvest Date: Estimated date of harvest
Growth Stage: Current stage of plant growth (seedling, vegetative, flowering, etc.)
Plant Count: Number of plants in the system
Nutrient Solution:

Nutrient Recipe: Proportions of macro and micronutrients
EC (Electrical Conductivity): Measure of nutrient concentration
pH Level: Acidity/alkalinity of the solution
Water Temperature: Temperature of the nutrient solution
Solution Change Frequency: How often the nutrient solution is changed or replenished
Dissolved Oxygen (DO): Oxygen levels in the nutrient solution
Environmental Controls:

Ambient Temperature: Temperature of the environment around the plants
Humidity: Relative humidity in the growing area
CO2 Levels: Concentration of carbon dioxide in the growing area
Light Intensity: Level of light (PAR â€“ Photosynthetically Active Radiation)
Light Schedule: Duration of the light and dark periods
Air Circulation: Details about fans or air flow systems
Pest/Disease Monitoring: Observations of any pest or disease presence
System Performance:

Yield: Amount of produce harvested
Growth Rate: Rate at which the plants are growing
Water Usage: Total volume of water used
Electricity Usage: Total energy consumed by the system (lighting, pumps, etc.)
System Maintenance: Records of cleaning, repairs, and other maintenance activities
Resource Inventory:

Seeds/Clones: Types and quantities of seeds or clones available
Nutrient Stock: Inventory of nutrient solutions and supplements
Replacement Parts: Inventory of spare parts for the system (pumps, lights, etc.)
Growing Media: Type and quantity of growing media in use or in stock
Employee Activity:

Task Assignments: Details of tasks assigned to staff
Work Log: Records of work performed, time spent, and any observations
Training Records: Information about staff training and qualifications
Financials:

Operating Costs: Breakdown of costs associated with running the hydroponic systems
Capital Expenditure: Costs related to the acquisition of long-term assets
Revenue: Income generated from crop sales
Regulatory Compliance:

Certifications: Any certifications the farm possesses (organic, GAP, etc.)
Inspection Dates: Dates of past and upcoming inspections or audits
Safety Protocols: Records of safety measures and procedures
Analytics and Reporting:

Historical Data: Historical performance data for trend analysis and optimization
Alerts/Notifications: Customizable alerts for critical thresholds and events
Report Generation: Ability to generate reports for yields, costs, and other KPIs
This list is comprehensive, but depending on the specific needs of your farm, some fields may be more relevant than others. Customizability and scalability are critical factors since farms may want to add or modify fields as the operation grows and changes.
